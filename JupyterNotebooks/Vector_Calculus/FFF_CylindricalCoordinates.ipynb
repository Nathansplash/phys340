    "# Polar coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate, radial distance or simply radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth. The radial coordinate is often denoted by r or ρ, and the angular coordinate by φ, θ, or t. Angles in polar notation are generally expressed in either degrees or radians (2π radians equals 360 degrees).\n",

    "# Cylindrical coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In math and physics, cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional coordinate system that specifies point positions by the distance from a chosen reference axis, the direction from the axis relative to a chosen reference direction, and the distance from a chosen reference plane perpendicular to the axis. The latter distance is given as a positive or negative number depending on which side of the reference plane faces the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of the system is the point where all three coordinates can be given as zero. This is the intersection between the reference plane and the axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The axis is variously called the cylindrical or longitudinal axis, to differentiate it from the polar axis, which is the ray that lies in the reference plane, starting at the origin and pointing in the reference direction. The third coordinate may be called the cylindrical z-coordinate. The cylindrical coordinate system is the natural extension of the two-dimensional polar coordinate system. The first coordinate is the same as in polar coordinates, the second denotes the angle of the point with respect to the reference direction. The third coordinate is the same as cylindrical coordinates.\n",

    "# Spherical coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin, its polar angle measured from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuthal angle of its orthogonal projection on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the polar coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radial distance is also called the radius or radial coordinate. The polar angle may be called colatitude, zenith angle, normal angle, or inclination angle. The use of symbols and the order of the coordinates differs between sources. In both physics and mathematics, the spherical coordinate system is commonly denoted as $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle measured from the zenith direction and $\\phi$ is the azimuth angle measured from the reference direction on the reference plane, which is often chosen to be the $x$-axis.\n",
