    "A function $f(z)$ is said to be holomorphic at a point $z_0$ if it is differentiable at every point in some neighborhood of $z_0$. If $f(z)$ is differentiable at every point in some open set $U$, then $f(z)$ is said to be holomorphic on $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $U$, then it is also continuous on $U$. In fact, it is infinitely differentiable on $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $U$, then it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations on $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $U$, then it has a power series expansion at every point in $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $U$, then it is analytic on $U$.\n",

    "## Holomorphic functions in classical physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Holomorphic functions are important in physics because they are solutions to the Laplace equation, which is a fundamental equation in classical physics (e.g. electromagnetism/EM waves) . The Laplace equation is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 f = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator. \n",

    "## Holomorphic functions in quantum physics\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, the wave function $\\psi(x)$ is a holomorphic function of the position $x$. This is because the Schr√∂dinger equation is a wave equation, and wave equations have solutions that are holomorphic functions.\n",

    "## Holomorphic functions in statistical mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical mechanics, the partition function $Z$ is a holomorphic function of the temperature $T$. This is because the partition function is related to the Helmholtz free energy, which is a holomorphic function of the temperature."
