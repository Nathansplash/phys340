    "# Proof that the square root of 2 is irrational\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by proving that the square root of 2 is irrational by contradiction. We will assume that the square root of 2 is rational and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof by contradiction\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the square root of 2 is rational. Then, there exist two integers $p$ and $q$ such that $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ have no common factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This last part of the definition is $crucial$.  If $p$ and $q$ shared a common factor, then we could cancel that common factor on the top and bottom of the fraction, to obtain a simpler form.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also assume that $p$ and $q$ are positive, since if they are negative, we can multiply both by -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Squaring both sides\n",
    "\n",
    "Squaring both sides of the equation $\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$, we get $2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$, which can be rewritten as $2q^2 = p^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evenness of $p^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This last equation tells us that $p^2$ is even. This means that $p$ is also even, since the square of an odd number is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evenness of $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $p$ is even, then $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the equation $2q^2 = p^2$, we get $2q^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$, which can be rewritten as $q^2 = 2k^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evenness of $q^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "This last equation tells us that $q^2$ is even. This means that $q$ is also even, since the square of an odd number is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common factors\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now shown that both $p$ and $q$ are even, which means that they share a common factor of 2. This contradicts our initial assumption that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have reached a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that the square root of 2 is rational must be false. Therefore, the square root of 2 is irrational. $\\blacksquare$"
